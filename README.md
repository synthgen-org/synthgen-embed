## What is Synthgen Embed?

Synthgen Embed is a JavaScript tool that allows you to:
- **Mark AI-generated content**: Wrap AI-generated text in `[ai]` tags, and the script will automatically style it.
- **Add transparency**: Display a clear disclaimer to inform readers about AI-generated content.
- **Boost trust**: Show your commitment to transparency and innovation.

This tool is part of the [synthgen.org](https://synthgen.org) initiative to empower transparency in the AI era.

---

## How It Works

The Synthgen Embed script scans your website for `[ai]` tags and transforms them into styled, authenticated content. It also appends a footer disclaimer to your website, ensuring readers understand which content is AI-generated.

### Example
Before:
```html
<p>This is human-written text. [ai]This is AI-generated text.[/ai]</p>
```

After:
```html
<p>This is human-written text. <span style="font-style: italic;">This is AI-generated text. <sup>âœ¨</sup></span></p>
<footer>
  <p>*Information italicized with a âœ¨ notation denotes text that was created wholly or partially by Artificial Intelligence.</p>
</footer>
```

---

## Getting Started

To use Synthgen Embed, follow these steps:

1. **Include the Script**:
   Add the following script tag to your website, just before the closing `</body>` tag:
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/synthgen-org/synthgen-embed/embed.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Wrap AI-Generated Content**:
   Wrap any AI-generated text in `[ai]` tags. For example:
   ```html
   <p>This is human-written text. [ai]This is AI-generated text.[/ai]</p>
   ```

3. **Publish and Enjoy**:
   Once the script is embedded, it will automatically transform your `[ai]` tags and add a footer disclaimer.

## Usage

### Customization
Currently, the script applies default styling to AI-generated content. In future updates, we plan to add customization options for badges, watermarks, and more.

### Browser Support
Synthgen Embed works on all modern browsers, including:
- Chrome
